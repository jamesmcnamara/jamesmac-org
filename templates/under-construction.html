<h1 class=header_underline>It's a funny story...</h1>
    <p>The other day, I was updating a library on my laptop and used the command <code>sudo apt-get purge some-library </code>. 
    <br><br>
    Some of you can already see how this story is going to play out.
    <br><br>
    I'm still a little blurry on the details, but the best theory so far is that that library had some kind of symbolic link to the directory /, 
    (which if you're not familiar,  is the grandparent directory on *nix operating systems)
    <br><br>
    I don't know if you've ever tried using a computer that is in the process of deleting its own operating system, 
    but it's a very surreal experience. Some apps continue to work as if nothing is happening, while others, like the display manager, 
    glitch worse than the original Pok&eacute;mon games did when you caught MissingNo.

    <br><br>
    Long story short, I lost all of my (embarassingly unbacked-up) code. I promise I normally compulsively git! I don't know what happened!
    <br><br>
    Fortunately I managed to extract the byte code off my phone, decompress and decompile it, but it's not very human-readable at the moment; 
    all of the documentation is gone, and all of my witty variable names got changed to "ParamLocalSparseArray".
    <br><br>
    If you would still like to see it, here is the link to the decompiled byte code:

    Otherwise, you can check back on <strong>Feb 10th</strong>; I've commited the preceding weekend to restoring the app to it's former glory.

    Sorry for the inconvenience! Here's a picture of Snarf from Thundercats for your troubles
