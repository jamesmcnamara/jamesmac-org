        <h1 class=dark_h1>Sudo Sudoku</h1>
            <h2 class=dark_h2>Question?</h2>
            What's the best way to cheat at Sudoku and look smart to that pretty girl on the train?<br><br>
            <h2 class=dark_h2>Answer</h2>
            Just take a picture of it with Sudo Sudoku!<br><br><br>
        
            <p>Sudo Sudoku is an app that uses computer vision algorithms coupled with OCR to digitize Sudoku boards, and then uses some home-grown AI logic to return the solved puzzle.</p>

    <p style='text-align:left'>iMadeIT is a program I ran with for the <a href='http://www.northeastern.edu/entrepreneurs/'>Northeastern Entrepreneurs Club</a> 
    that teaches students with any level of programming background the fundamentals of web development in Flask by creating a Facebook clone.
    <br><br>
    To provide a sandbox for students, and add to the "Hey Mom, look what I made!" factor, I created <a href='imadeit.nu'>iMadeIT.nu</a>, which, after a user created an account on the website, created an identical account on the server that they could SSH into, and host their web app on our domain.
    <br><br>

    In addition, the site serves as a one-stop source for information about events, activities, as well as the source code to the site itself, other smaller web-apps, and other useful python resources

        <p>For our Capstone project at Northeastern University, my group and I developed a automated trading bot which strives to predict the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency markets</p>
        <p>Our bot pulled down market data from various exchanges, as well as posts about the currencies on Reddit.com and then performed a two tiered analysis: first, it regressed the market data over various timeframes to identify the general pattern, and fed the results into a machine-learning algorithm which measured it's own historical accuracy to determine how much confidence it had in the continuation of a given trend. Second, we seperately fed Reddit posts which were flagged as relevant into a NLP suite that determined the sentiment of each post.</p>
        <p> We fed the results into a genetic algorithm that spawned traders with the previous analysis and randomly generated weights for their confidence and sentiment. We then simulated trades with these agents, and bred the agents through successive generations until we had the strongest trader of the lot, who became our official live trader (until it was outperformed)</p>
        <p>It was a very fun project, and while the group decided to leave the code closed source for now, <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and I'd be happy to arrange a viewing!</p>

            <p>As I've mentioned before, I am no web designer, so I used this website to force myself to learn the (very) basics of HTML and CSS, and while I'm sure it does look like someone's first foray into front end dev, I did write every line of it myself, without any WordPress or MySpace or any of those gimmicks kids use these days.</p>
            <p>Admittedly, this site is rather static, but in general I like to make code available. If you like piles of disorganized HTML, this one's for you!

            <p>You're mocking up a website and need some filler text. Lorem Ipsum? Uch so mainstream. What you need is <a href="http://hipsum.co/">Hipster Ipsum</a>. But going to their site, typing in how many paragraphs you want, oof, it sounds exahusting.</p>
            <center>
                <strong>NEVER FEAR! YOUR MISERY IS OVER</strong><br>

            <p>Just query:</p>

            <center><a href="/api/?p=4">jamesmac.org/api/?p={the number of paragraphs of hipster text you'd like}</a></center><br>
            And you'll receive all the "iPhone fingerstache Wes Anderson PBR" one developer could ever need.
