<h1 class=header_underline>Thomas Petterfy and the Chamber of High-Frequency Trading</h1>
<p>As a kid, Thomas Petterfy loved to build and he loved to trade. Growing up in Communist Budapest, these were not viewed as the healthiest interests; he was nearly expelled from elementary school for distributing pieces of Juicy Fruit gum his friend had brought him from Austria. It wasn’t the gum that bothered the principal; it was the 150% profit margin Petterfy had slipped into his pocket.  </p><p>Realizing he was a square peg in a circular country, he set sail for the land of squares: in 1965, he got a job as a draftsman at an American engineering firm. Within his first few days of work, Petterfy laid eyes on the most beautiful visage he would ever see, and knew in a moment that this was the siren to which he would give his life. Yes, Petterfy was given access to his first computer. Immediately enthralled with the capabilities and possibilities the technology promised, he left engineering and walked into his dream job working with a trading firm that thought maybe, just maybe, there was a way to incorporate computers into the way they traded. They started Petterfy off with a comfortably impossible task: figure out a way to use computers to value a particularly hairy equity derivative called a stock option.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about stock options in our society, most often in connection with CEO’s compensation. They sound deceptively simple: you buy a contract from somebody (anybody who’s willing to sell one to you, really) that says at any time from now until time T, you can buy a specific companies stock for a fixed price, X. Price goes up: buy the stock from your deal-partner at X, sell it on the market for S, pocket S-X, and Robert’s your mother’s brother. Stock price goes down: just walk away. You have no obligation to buy the stock. Whether it falls to X-1 or X-10,000, you just lose the couple bucks you paid for the option.</p>
<p>But when trying to calculate what an option is worth this asymmetry throws a cog in the wheels. If a stock price has a tendency to move all over the place, whether or not you want to buy the stock has more to do with your appetite for risk than anything else. But the option on a volatile stock? There’s just a higher probability that it’ll sky-rocket, and who cares if the company goes bankrupt? Trying to determine the value of a stock option based on a given stock’s history of prices quickly escalates out of the algebra and simple calculus that financial professionals had in their tool box into the stratospherically complicated rocket science of stochastic calculus and obscure probability distributions. When two economists, named Fischer Black and Byron Scholes, and savant mathematician Bob Merton published their stochastic partially differentiable equation for option pricing in 1973, they were awarded with a Nobel Prize, and executive roles at a $100 billion hedge fund (and my is THAT a story to tell, but we’ll save it for another time).</p>
<p>But Petterfy was no typical financial professional. After just nine months of research, he had come up with a workable model for options pricing that could run on his office’s computer. But unlike Black and Scholes, Tom had no intention of sharing his model with the world. He was holding a golden goose and it would make him rich. The only problem was he couldn’t bring it anywhere. In the late 1960’s, computerized trading were not two words you put together, like Bostonian and charming. And his office’s computer wasn’t some laptop; bringing it onto the trading floor would have been like carting a filing cabinet up and down Wall Street. So instead, he printed out hundreds of charts, displaying option values at different intersections of stock prices and time to expirations, and after donning a jacket with dozens of pockets, filled each of them with stacks of these tables and headed to the trading floor. He quickly made a name for himself in the pits of the AMEX; not so much for his brilliant valuation techniques, so much as for being that Hungarian guy with the funny accent and the huge jacket spewing numbers. And although he was making money, the engineer in him knew there must be a better way.</p>
<p>In 1983, Petterfy started his own firm, hired a few engineers, and bought a Quotron machine. The Quotron machine is a minor footnote in financial history: they were one of the very first digital, on-demand stock quote products. The novelty wasn’t what interested Petterfy though, so much as the oversights the company had made on their legal agreements. You see, unlike many other electronic quote providers, Quotron put no limits on what you could do with their data feed, leaving Petterfy free to hack into the Quotron machine. No, literally, he used a pair of wire cutters, a soldering iron, and a silliscope to cut the data wire out of the Quotron and hard wire it into his valuation computer. Now the computer could calculate any stock’s fair option price in real time. Petterfy and his engineers then got to work building pre-Apple-I iPads: touchscreen tablet computers that his traders could take on to the trading floor that were pre-loaded with the tables the computer had calculated the day before, so that they needn’t worry about filing through hundreds of papers. But the iPads had a bit of a quirk. It wasn’t so much that they would display the wrong information.</p>
<p>It was that they would explode.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, the lithium batteries would overheat and cause plumes of smoke to pour out of the device. Rookie traders would scramble for the exits or hit the floor, and veteran traders would reminisce on the days of yore, when their biggest concern had been the Hungarian guy with the techni-number dreamcoat.</p>
<p>It was to the delight of Petterfy, pit traders, and Fire Marshalls alike when, in 1987, NASDAQ announced the introduction of the new NASDAQ terminal, and the ability to trade electronically. Petterfy and his team wasted no time buying their very own terminal, splicing the cord, and connecting it to the valuation-Quotron monstrosity. They soldered, they mapped, they coded, they tweaked, tweaked, tweaked, and then turned on the world’s first fully automated algorithmic trading platform.</p>
<p>And it began to trade.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>So much so that within a few weeks, a top NASDAQ official came down to Petterfy’s New York office to check on what he expected to be the busiest trading house in the city. Instead, he found a handful of engineers in a sleepy office, while three terminals hummed softly in the back, moving billions of dollars back and forth across the country. The official knew that what they were doing was against the rules, was cheating, but he wasn’t quite sure how. After pouring through the NASDAQ rules and regulations, he returned to Petterfy with a clear infraction: the manual clearly stated that orders must be entered via the terminal keyboard. By sending signals directly to the terminal, Petterfy was violating his contract and could be barred from securities dealing. </p>
<p>NASDAQ gave Petterfy one week to remedy this problem, leaving him between his metaphorical Scylla and Charybdis. His entire life he had dreamed of the day when he could fully automate the trading process, and now that it was here, the very people who gave it to him were taking it away. But on the other hand, he understood his responsibility to uphold his contractual obligations. In the end he relented, and decided he would enter all orders via the keyboard, and when the NASDAQ official came back the next week, Petterfy led him into the back room to show him this was now the case.</p>
<p>Petterfy had built a robot that typed. Very, very quickly. </p>
<p>As high frequency trading remains under intense scrutiny by brilliant academics, unscrupulous congressmen, and ill-informed citizens alike, many pundits predict that the days of HFT will end like the days of Greece: a notable bright spot of intellectual advancement and prowess that was bested by its own corruption and arrogance. But a generation of engineers, mathematicians, and Juicy Fruit traders doesn’t quite think that HFT regulation will be the end of the game. No matter what the rules are, there’s always going to be someone willing to build a robot that types. </p>

<h1 style='font-size:1.8em' class=header_underline>Ever Since I Can Remember, I’ve Always Wanted to Be a Gangster –<em>Henry Hill, 1955</em></h1>
<p>Alec Litowitz was very, very clever.</p>
<p>As a mathematics and anthropology double major at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he had excelled. He shone even brighter at the University of Chicago, where he received not only his MBA, but a JD to boot. But it was at Citadel Investments Group that he made a name for himself. Citadel, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, is infamous for its brutal corporate culture. With 50% annual turnover, you’re statistically more likely to be killed by a meteorite then spend your career there. Alec must have slept through his statistics courses during those long, cold Boston winters (Lord knows I did) because within 10 years, he had become a top executive, head of equity strategy, and a senior partner. Deciding it was time to run his own firm, he signed a two year non-compete with Citadel, and took his wife gallivanting across Europe hunting rare antiquities, not unlike Indiana Jones, while he waited for his run at riches. The year was 2003; he was 36. </p>
<p>In March 2005, Alec returned to an unfamiliar market. The U.S. housing “miracle” had been in full swing in his absence; the economy was booming, and the financial landscape was dominated by “CDOs” and “CDSs”; opaque financial derivatives that had materialized from the aether like a gift from the heavens, pouring money like fountains while sporting AAA Investment Grade ratings from the  credit rating agencies; indications, nay PROOF, that American financial engineering had triumphed over the dark ages of risk and uncertainty. It was a brave new world. </p>
<p>Alec saw opportunity like no other, and after raising over $1.7 billion in investments, he opened the doors of Magnetar Capital. <p>
<p><h2>CDO 101 – Corporation: Debt Only</h2></p>
<p>CDOs, or Collateralized Debt Obligations, were based on the principles of diversification: You start with lots of risky mortgage debt from all over the country, dash in some credit card and student loan debt, a pinch of boring, old safe US Treasuries, and maybe just a kicker of debt driven derivatives for flavor (we’ll explain these later). These were called MBSs, or Mortgage Backed Securities. Hundreds of these MBSs would be combined together (in mind-bogglingly complex ways that everyone was too afraid to admit they didn’t understand) to create CDOs. Since the debt was coming from so many places, and from markets so seemingly unrelated to each other, the packages were statistically “safe”; there was no historical precedent for every credit market collapsing at once. Investors in CDOs received the high returns from the risky debt (because each of those loans was risky by itself), but without being fully exposed to the risk of each investment, due to the magic of diversification. But what was interesting about CDOs was that they weren’t funds that people could invest in. They were corporations.</p>
<p>Corporations are allowed to lend money to people with different levels of precedence: the very first money out the door must go to senior secured debt holders, and if it doesn’t, the SSD holders get to claim the corporation’s stuff. Because of the security SSDs have, they receive the lowest return. Next in line is senior debt holders, who have no pre-set claims to property, but if the company goes bankrupt, their kids are getting lots of pens and toner for Christmas. Next up is junior debt, and finally mezzanine debt / equity: the absolute last people to get paid, but if they are, paid handsomely. </p>
<p>By packaging up debt tied to mortgages (which can be thought of as the assets of a company), and giving them the legal standing of a corporation, an investment bank was able to satisfy hundreds of different investors’ appetite for risks and return with the same debt. Crazy cowboy hedge fund manager? Take some 20% return equity, buddy boy! Pension fund? Maybe stick to the 3% SSD. </p>
<p>Oh, one more thing. Say I wanted more protection against a company (or CDO) failing to pay me back, but the company won’t promise me any assets. Well, I can just go out into the marketplace, and look for someone who has a different view of their risk than I do. Let’s make up a hypothetical, reckless insurance company who is willing to bet that no company or CDO will ever miss a payment ever; let’s call them, I dunno, AIG. Well, I could offer this “AIG” a couple bucks a month for a CDS, or Credit Default Swap: effectively an insurance policy on the debt. If my CDO misses a payment, AIG will pay it. Unlike home or fire insurance though, I can buy 50 times more insurance than the product is worth. I can even buy insurance on a product I don’t even own. </p>
<p>CDOs could then be built not only out of piles of MBSs, but chunks of other CDOs and even from CDSs that had been sold to other people. Because isn’t insuring the debt of someone else for a monthly fee almost exactly the same as owning the debt itself?</p>
<p>Sound a little crazy? Welcome to the monkey house. </p>
<p><h2>Back to the Bubble</h2></p>
<p>When Magnetar opened its doors the spring of 2005, the CDO market was cooling off. As defaults on subprime loans began to mount, investors had had their fill of the risky equity level investments (so called mezzanine tranche debt), and wanted to move to the safe, AAA upper level debt. Credit spreads were widening, an indication that the cost of buying insurance and borrowing, as well perceived risk were on the rise. Investment bankers were in a pickle; they wanted nothing more than to continue gorging themselves on the enormous fees they could generate by creating these corporations (sometimes as much as $70 million from a single CDO), but if they couldn’t find anyone to take the riskiest piece of the debt, they would be stuck with them, and their highly likely losses.</p>
<p>Cue Magnetar, descending upon Wall Street like Prince Ali Ababwa, whispering the sweetest nothings a CDO banker could dream to hear: Magnetar wanted to buy mezzanine debt. And they wanted a lot of it. </p>
<p>Thanks to Magnetar, predictions that 2006 would be a shrinking year for CDOs joined Bill Gates proclamation that 64 MB of RAM is all we’d ever need as one of the most laughable predictions of the century. Within 2 months, the tiny hedge fund had sponsored (Wall Street speak for agreed to buy the riskiest, equity tranche) over 15 CDOs, totaling an estimated $23 billion dollars in debt, prompting others to join the party, credit spreads to tighten, and the Wall Street bacchanalia to enter its 5th year . Magnetar had an appetite for the riskiest type of CDOs, termed SCDOs for synthetic collateralized debt obligations. Most of the debt involved wasn’t actual mortgage debt, but credit default swaps on existing mortgages.  And when the CDOs did have debt, Magnetar was happy to take the highest returning, highly risky subprime debt. Investment bankers could have kissed these glorious idiots. These CDOs gave them the opportunity to hedge against risky debt in their portfolios, offload their riskiest mortgages, provide the safest, upper deck investments to their clients, continue to reap egregious profits on the underwriting and creation of the CDOs, all while sticking Magnetar with riskiest, most guaranteed to fail stick of dynamite. It was an echo of sentiment all up and down Wall Street when, in March 2007, Business Week ran an article titled “Who Will Get Shredded?” that understatedly acknowledged that the little, Chicago based hedge fund had “shown bad timing”.</p>
<p>But something didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>Former Citadel employees and past business partners knew Alec. Even those who didn’t, knew of him; his reputation far preceded him. Alec was brilliant; he had shown it time and time again. Why now was he letting the large returns make him so blind to the obvious risks involved? Many shrugged it off it as simply the folly of hubris, but when Andrew Sterge brought his team from AJ Sterge Investments, and prominent investor Michael Gross left Apollo Capital to join Magnetar towards the end of 2006, people began to scratch their heads. What did Magnetar know that they didn’t?</p>
<p>Michael Henriques was one of the first to start putting the pieces together. Working for Deutsche Bank, he was point man for Magnetar’s sponsoring of a new CDO, named Orion, which would be managed day to day by the company NIBC. Magnetar was using its influence as sponsor, through Henriques, to put pressure on NIBC to allow Magnetar input into which CDSs, bonds and MBSs would be allowed into the CDO. This was not an unusual request, so NIBC was open to suggestions, and showed Magnetar the preliminary asset list they had put together for Orion. A top executive from Magnetar sent back a list of proposed changes that flew in the face of reason like that bird that just hit my window. Magnetar wasn’t even trying to reduce its risk: it was actively requesting riskier investments. NIBC refused to go forward with the deal citing recklessness and incompetence on the part of Magnetar, and the talks ceased. But for Henriques they were just beginning; he finally had the answer to a question that had been plaguing CDO bankers for months. He knew what Magnetar was doing. </p>
<p>By the end of 2007, Magnetar had sponsored close to 40 CDOs, worth a total of $40 billion. But this didn’t mean Magnetar was on the hook for the full 40; in fact, Magnetar’s financial engineers needed only to put down less than 5-10% of a CDOs total value to make it worthwhile for the investment banks to create them. While Magnetar appeared to be on a spending spree that would make Kevin from Home Alone 2 jealous, they had only taken on about $3 billion in risky investments, with the investment banks and the economy at large taking on the remaining “safe” $37 billion. So long as the risky debt continued to pay, Magnetar received hefty monthly fees on this debt, which they could take to the private credit default swap market, and thanks to the skyrocketing credit markets, insure their debt at a rate far below the risk of the investment. Pretty clever, huh? They didn’t stop there. Very cheaply, they could insure against the failure of the entirety of the CDOs they had sponsored, even the parts they didn’t own. Since they had sponsored the CDOs, they had input into what assets would be included, and time and time again successfully lobbied for the riskiest bonds they had researched to be included. CDOs were so large and complex that the vast majority of large institutions didn’t put forth the effort to comb through them piece by piece to understand their composition, and as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan later said in congressional hearings, “You would need a doctorate in math just to begin.” In some cases, Magnetar had as much as 30 times more bet against their own CDOs as they had in them.  So long as the CDOs continued to pay, Magnetar would have more than enough money to maintain their CDS payments and earn a handsome return. As soon as the CDOs cracked, they would receive their payments from their CDSs, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars on the CDOs they didn’t own. They had done what a hedge fund was supposed to do: hedge their bets. And they had done it masterfully.</p>
<p>When the dust had settled at the end of 2008, the housing market collapse had toppled two of the five largest investment banks, brought the other three to the brink, forced AIG, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into nationalization, bankrupted dozens of hedge funds, and trillions of dollars in speculative wealth had been wiped from the global financial system. 68% of the CDOs built from subprime mortgages had experienced significant losses in the last 6 months, but 96% of Magnetar’s CDOs had collapsed. These very banks and funds who had silently mocked Magnetar, taken advantage of their ignorance, and feigned camaraderie realized Magnetar had been doing the exact same thing, and was laughing about it all the way to the bank: in just two years, Litowitz had turned his $1.7 billion in startup into $7.8 billion, which was split between many lucky investors, employees, and one former Deutsche Bank employee who had joined Magnetar in late 2006 named Michael Henriques. </p>
<p>Michael Lewis’ 2010 smash hit The Big Short explored the experiences of 5 prescient money managers who foresaw the coming crash, and staked their reputations, careers as well as their fortunes betting against the impending financial doom. The thrills the story gives are nail-biting: as the market climbs to dizzying highs, our money manager’s clients abandon them, taking their money with them, and forcing our heroes closer to the brink of bankruptcy as they struggle to maintain their expensive short bets. Stories of these soothsayers are common lore on Wall Street, like stories of a ridiculed scientist who kept struggling down a blind path until finally making the discovery she worked for against all odds. But to this day, no strategy garners more respect than the elegant, self-financing, self-reinforcing, morally apathetic, and chillingly effective Magnetar Trade.</p>
<p>Alec Litowitz was very, very clever.</p>
